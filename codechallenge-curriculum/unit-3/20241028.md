## What is PEDAC?
- A problem solving tool
- Split into two:
    1. Proecssing the Problem (PEDA)
    2. Coding with Intent (C)
- helps save time, catch edge cases, write high-quality algos, build technical communication skills

### P - Problem
- Identifying expected **inputs** and **outputs**
- Make the requirements **explicit**
- Create a **mental model** of the problem
{% hint style="info" %}
Try rewording the problem in your own words!
{% endhint %}

### E - Examples/Edge Cases
- Write your own example to validate understanding of the problem
- Test what may be **edge cases**

### D - Data Structure
- Describing what you will use, and **why**

### A - Algorithm
- Writing out the solution step-by-step, usually with **pseudocode**
- Formal definition: _A set of instructions designed to perform a specific task._

### C - Code
- finally doing **it**
