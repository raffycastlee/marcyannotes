## Outline
### 1. The Tech Interview
- _usually_ three buckets:
   1. Behavioral Interviews
   2. Technical Screening
      - the **only** asynchronous step
   3. Technical Interviews
### 2. Tech Interview ~~Prep~~ Routine
- Mastering a programming language
   - Some companies are rigid (can't just use your preference)
- Honing up on the ff:
   1. Problem Solving
   2. Designing **efficient** solutions
   3. **Communicating** solutions using technical technology
### 3. Code Challenge Curriculum
- **Daily** and **Intentional**
   - on leetcode; codesignal _(also generally referred to as GCF, or General Coding Framework)_
   - 60 min after _Mindful Mornings_!
   - sometimes thematic, **MOSTLY** random
   - _catch-ups_ available for missed sessions
   - _not graded_ but pay attention to **scores**!
      - 389 Score **AT LEAST** three times throughout the program
### 4. Code Challenge Philosphies
> "You can only cook what's in the fridge!"
- Programming is like _cooking_:
   - fridge <<>> knowledge base _(learned!)_
   - tools/equipment would be the natural predisposition _(so don't feel bad; it's not the largest piece in the pie!)_
- Fluency

> "Go slow now to go far later."
> - _probably_ Reuben (2019)
